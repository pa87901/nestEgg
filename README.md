# Nest Egg

Nest Egg is a work in progress.
I intend to build a portfolio view that updates with securities prices each day.
It will record positions and trades, calculate P&L and display performance over time.

## Aims
* The blotter on the front end will display the user's holdings.
* There will be a ticket form for entering new trades.
* The blotter will connect to IEX's API via Nest Egg's server to request stock prices at the start of each day.
* There will be a worker on the back end that will run every minute to fetch updated prices from IEX.
* An authentication service may be used to manage users and authentication.
* Many users can create an account on Nest Egg and store their equity portfolios.

Stay tuned ...
